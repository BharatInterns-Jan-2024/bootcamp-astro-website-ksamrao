<pre>
 Hello, I am Flavio Copes. You may know me from my blog 
    <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/">flaviocopes.com </a>, my free programming ebooks on 
<a href="https://thevalleyofcode.com/">thevalleyofcode.com</a>, or my freeCodeCamp contributions. I
have been organizing this Bootcamp every year since 2020. I
am 39 years old, Italian. I graduated in computer engineering
from Politecnico di Milano in 2008. My passion for computers
dates back to the 1980s. I have been a Linux fan since 1998, a
Mac enthusiast since 2005, bought my first JavaScript book in 
1998, and consider myself a professional JavaScript developer 
                                        since 2012.

   Just a few words to let you know I'm serious about these 
                                            things.

       My mission is to help you become a Web Developer.

But my most valuable takeaway from this course is the newbie learning community that learns together with you. For me, this course boost my confidence to apply for dev jobs, and alhamdulillah, 1 month later I got a full time job as developer.”"

It's also teaches you a wide range of skills, vs udemy courses where you'll learn 5 skill sets maybe at most. Here you'll learn 20+ (probably more). I already feel like I've learned 20x what I could have found on my own. Thanks Flavio!”"

I'm a QA Engineer at a tech startup and I'm learning a lot about the tools that my Engineering team already uses and I think it's helping me to be better at my job. I also really appreciate that you can work on this course at your own pace.”"

I was so nervous to sign up for this, but after a month, I am getting to know some great people from all over who share my enthusiasm for building web apps. In a short time I have already learned a LOT. I love Tailwind CSS, and now that we are beginning the JavaScript portion of the bootcamp, I am even more excited than I was before the class started. Honestly, this has been one of the best decisions I have made. Thanks for all of your efforts to lift us up as pro developers and for giving me a break on the tuition. It is worth every penny and then some!”"

        review="“I started learning programming a couple of months before the bootcamp started, and it felt overwhelming to figure out how I should approach it. I tried using other tutorials, but the ones I found were mostly video-based and I found it hard to follow, especially since I am a beginner. However, this bootcamp is text based, and I find it much more enjoyable to be able to go back and read the material again, I feel I am absorbing the information in a different way. Also, the bootcamp has given me a good structure for learning all the topics that are necessary to become a full stack developer, which would have taken me a very long time to figure out on my own. In addition, the discord community is very friendly, and I have found lots of help and information from the chat.”"

This was the first time I was involved in webinar training, and it has been a great learning experience, there are so many little things to know and learn one couldn’t possibly learn it on their own, and that’s where Flavio and the JS Bootcamp really make the difference. Also, I found it to be a very good webinar for new-comers to the web world. The information provided will prove to be very useful in practice.”"

And I want to tell you about my expressions about The JS Bootcamp. It was really awesome. I found this course at the end of May and understood, that is what I really want to learn in the summer, while I was on vacation. I don’t know English very well, and this course was really good to learn it with Flavio. You should be very hardworking to finish that course, because there are a lot of new information, and you need to understand it in a little period of time. At the and or this course you can try to find work, because now you know all concepts of JS, and it is enough to be JS developer.”"

    name="Mirjana Tomic"
    review="“The JS Bootcamp is in a written form and available forever which is great. You can always go back and refresh your memory, and you will since it's so full of information, tips and tricks - the curriculum is huge! I am a junior front end for about a year and a half now and yet I found so many details in the course materials that I never learned in a proper way before. Also finally learned and understood the bigger picture of frontend development, not just HTML, CSS and JavaScript but all other things that come into play like npm, webpack, babel, networking, and many other concepts that are missing from most courses I took in the past. Pair that with a very, very low price, multiple discount options, very friendly and helpful instructor Flavio and you have a great deal. Community is also just the right size, not too big, not too small, someone is always there to help you move through curriculum. Flavio also leaves no questions / requests unanswered. ”"

    name="Marco Kuprat"
    review="“I have learnt a lot and really could expand my knowledge. One of the main things I learned: there's so much more you can do with JavaScript today compared to 12 years ago, so it is inevitable to stay up to date. This bootcamp is the right place, because you get information that starts from zero up to advanced modern topics. And the Discord chat gives you the opportunity to discuss with the other participants in order to seek for and provide help or just to chat. I can recommend the JavaScript Bootcamp to everyone who is involved in web development!”"

It feels like you are doing some peer programming with a more experienced colleague and friend who takes great care of your understanding and rapid implementation of what is covered. It is also great if you want to ramp up rapidly on ReactJS, and discover new things like Netlify, MACH, and JAMstack. Thank you, Flavio for putting your learning materials together.”"

    <Faqs
    title ="Will I have access to the course after course completion?"
    body="After completion of the course, you will have access to recorded sessions of the live classes, all the material that you have worked on, and all the coding problems."
    />
    <Faqs
    title ="Who is this bootcamp for?"
    body="Too many tutorials and little action? This bootcamp is perfect for you. Web development looks complex to you? This bootcamp is perfect for you. You're a frontend dev and you want to get more fullstack/backend skills? This bootcamp is great for you. You're a backend dev and you want to get more frontend skills? This bootcamp is great for you."
    />
    <Faqs
    title ="What's the difference with a $10 Udemy course?"
    body="This is a different thing. It's a cohort-based course. You will have access to a community chat of students that started the course on the same day as you did. This means you have accountability and motivation. Make friends with your fellow class mates to get the most out of the bootcamp, and challenge each other! How many Udemy courses did you buy but never followed through after the first couple lessons? There's no way this bootcamp will end up like the dozens of courses you purchased but never finished."
    />
    <Faqs
    title ="What's the effort required?"
    body="It depends, but I estimate about 1 or 2 hours every week day. Or do 3/4 hours on weekend days. If you do more, it's better because the more time you study, the more things will 'stick'. But that's a start. It's not super intensive, it's a marathon, not a sprint."
    />
    <Faqs
    title ="I want to know the schedule"
    body="The bootcamp is not 'live'. You can adjust it around your school/work/life schedule. I unlock a new module every week. The only thing I ask is to stay on top of the weekly schedule, meaning I will release a new module on Tuesday, complete it by next Tuesday when a new module will unlock. Most students will follow the schedule and you'll find more activity and community support, because everyone is doing those lessons along with you. This is the best way to stay on top of the schedule and complete the bootcamp successfully."
    />
    <Faqs
    title ="What's the format of the lessons?"
    body="Every week to I will unlock multiple modules, each containing various lessons. Lessons are text based. Text is better to parse, to copy code snippets from, search and reference later."
    />
    <Faqs
    title ="Will I get a certificate at the end?"
    body="Yes. Once you finish the course, you ask me the certificate of attendance and I will issue that to you."
    />
    <Faqs
    title ="Do you have a refund policy?"
    body="Yes. You have a no-questions-asked 100% refund if you are not happy with the bootcamp and if you don't think you get value from it, up to 14 days after the start of the Bootcamp. This is also for subscriptions: no refunds after the first 2 weeks."
    />
    <Faqs
    title ="What kind of project will we create?"
    body="We'll work on a very cool project management SaaS app, complete with authentication, permissions, payments, and more. It's a real-world project that will give you a lot of experience and will be a great addition to your portfolio."
    />
    <Faqs
    title ="Will I have access to the course lesson at the end of the bootcamp?"
    body="Yes, they will be yours forever."
    />
    <Faqs
    title ="Can I follow the bootcamp at my own pace?"
    body="Yes! I do unlock 1 new module every week but there is no problem in going a bit slower. Some people have more time, some less. There's no problem, although I see more success rates in students that stay on top of the schedule."
    />
    <Faqs
    title ="What are the prerequisites?"
    body="I assume some basic knowledge on how the web works, HTML, CSS, some JavaScript basics. If you're not sure, you can ask me and I can help you understand if you're ready for the bootcamp."
    />
    <Faqs
    title ="I joined the 2020/2021/2022/2023 cohort. Is this bootcamp different? Can I join again?"
    body="Compared to previous editions, in 2024 I have rewritten 100% of the material. The bootcamp is a completely new course compared to past editions, so if you want to learn the new material, you should join again. I will have a discount for you since you joined the bootcamp in the past."
    />
    <Faqs
    title ="What time of day are the lessons?"
body="The bootcamp is not 'live'. We'll have students from New Zealand, Nigeria, Brazil, United States, Norway, India.. all over the world! So it's impossible to find hours that work for everyone. Instead, the bootcamp is asynchronous. You pick the hours that best suit your schedule, and you connect to the students Discord chat where you'll always find people you can talk to, to discuss ideas or clarify some concepts together."
    />
    <Faqs
    title ="Is the training instructor led?  How does it work?"
    body="I (Flavio Copes) built the entire curriculum, lessons and projects. I will unlock access to a new lessons module each week. It's not like in school where I'll have lectures. Instead, you find the lessons on a web page and you go through each lesson on your own. The content will be text based. The particular thing about the bootcamp cohort is that you're studying privately, but you're not on your own. You'll have other students you can talk to, ask questions, help each other. All of them are doing the same things you're doing now. And I (the instructor) will be in the Discord chat as much as possible to help everyone during the bootcamp, so that no one gets left behind and we can all complete the course successfully."
